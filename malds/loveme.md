i wasnt neglected as a child, my parents loved me a lot, they still love me, obviously. but i feel like something isnt correct  
i feel empty, i feel like something's missing. i feel like theres a list of things i had to do and i missed one thing. i dont know what it is  
what i do know is im extremely unstable. one second im all "yay happi fun uwu" and the next second i feel like i dont have the right to live  
i cut all all ties with people around me in real life. i dont go out, i dont have fun with my friends, i dont do anything  
i feel like i found my purpose but lost it at the same time.  
it hurts. it hurts a lot.  
i dont know what im supposed to put in that empty hole, i tried talking to nea a lot, but its still not filled  
i feel like i have to do something, but i dont know what it is  
thats enough beating around the bush. let me be frank; i want to feel like im doing the right thing  
i wanna be held, i want someone to tell me that everything's ok, even if its a lie  
i guess im just spoiled, asking for the love i dont deserve  
i already passed the "downbad" checkpoint, i dont care enough to hide this  
please say "i love you" to me. i need it. even if you hate me, even if you think im a piece of shit who deserves nothing, just say it to me.  
it hurts. the fact that im asking strangers to tell me i love you just so i can feel something, anything.  
i dont wanna live my "real life" anymore. i dont wanna die, i just wanna vanish. i want everyone to forget i was a thing, i ever existed  

sorry for asking for your love. i dont deserve it. give it to someone who isnt an asshole
