think of something you use daily, lets say your espresso maker; theres an input and an output. you give it power, water and coffee, it gives out espresso  
a car, you give it oil, it lets you get to places  
imagine a machine that doesnt have any outputs, why would you give it an input?  
imagine a car that requires oil but doesnt go anywhere, it just wastes and burns the oil and does nothing in return, why would you keep that thing around? you throw it away obviously
im that car. i dont have a use, im just there, wasting oxygen, food, water. i dont have a useful output  
i dont desrve to be around. all i do is harming people, making them annoyed, mad, sad  
i wanna do something, be something, even if its a pr that gets merged, even if its just making people laugh for a split second, i care about that  
please dont throw me out, im trying to be useful
