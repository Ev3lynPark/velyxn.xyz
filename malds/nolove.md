i wanna write something, because i feel like shit and whenever i do feel like shit i write it here, but i dont know what to write  
heres what ive been thinking about:  
remember what i said about incels and chainsaw man? i feel like im a part of them  
im no use, completely replacable and dont matter to everyone. i dont do anything useful, i havent made a single buck of money on my own in my entire life, i bother people to do things that i want for me, im a miserable, entitled piece of shit, and i dont deserve anyone's love. including catto  
as ironic as it sounds, i just want to be loved.
